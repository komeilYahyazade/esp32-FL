# Federated Learning Project

## Overview

This project implements a **Federated Learning** system with two primary components:

1. **FederatedLearningESP32**: This component runs on an ESP32 device and participates in the federated learning process by locally training a model and sending updates to the server.
2. **FederatedLearningServer**: This component manages the federated learning process on the server-side, aggregating updates from ESP32 clients and coordinating the training process.
